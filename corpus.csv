doc1,The Multi-Agent GenAI framework combines reinforcement learning agents with large language models to predict stock trends.
doc2,Agent Alpha collects real-time financial news and computes sentiment scores using FinBERT.
doc3,"Agent Beta monitors market indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and trading volume for signal generation."
doc4,Agent Gamma integrates signals from sentiment and technical indicators using a transformer-based fusion model.
doc5,The ensemble of agents communicates through a coordination layer using weighted consensus for final stock price prediction.
doc6,Historical data from NASDAQ and NYSE were used to train the agents on 5 years of daily prices.
doc7,The proposed model outperforms LSTM and ARIMA baselines with an average RMSE reduction of 12%.
doc8,"Sentiment scores are derived from Twitter, Reddit, and financial news articles collected via API integration."
doc9,The sentiment-agent uses a fine-tuned FinBERT model for polarity detection on market-related tweets.
doc10,"Market-agent relies on quantitative features like SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD for trend estimation."
doc11,"Experiments show that when sentiment signals are positive and technical momentum is bullish, the ensemble predicts upward movement with 87% accuracy."
doc12,The ablation study demonstrates that removing the sentiment-agent decreases performance by 9% on F1 score.
